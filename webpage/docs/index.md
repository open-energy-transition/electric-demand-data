## About

DemandCast is a Python-based project focused on collecting, processing, and forecasting hourly electricity demand data. The aim of this project is to support energy planning studies by using machine learning models to generate hourly time series of future electricity demand or for countries without available data.

### Features

- Retrieval of open hourly and sub-hourly electricity demand data from public sources ([ETL](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/demandcast/tree/main/ETL)).
- Retrieval of weather and socio-economic data ([ETL](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/demandcast/tree/main/ETL)).
- Forecasting using machine learning models ([models](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/demandcast/tree/main/models/)).
- Modular design for adding new countries or data sources.
- Support for reproducible, containerized development.

The project is in active development, we are always looking for suggestions and contributions!

## Getting started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-energy-transition/demandcast.git
cd demandcast
```

### 2. Set up your environment

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as a pacakge manager to install the required dependencies and create an environment stored in `.venv`.

`uv` can be used within the provided Dockerfile or installed standalone (see [installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)).

The `ETL` folder and each subfolder in the `models` directory—each representing a separate model—contain their own `pyproject.toml` files that define the dependencies for that module.

To set up the environment, run:
```bash
cd path/to/folder
uv sync
```

Alternatively, you may use `conda` to install the packages listed in the respective `pyproject.toml`.

### 3. Run scripts

Scripts can be run directly using:

```bash
cd path/to/folder
uv run script.py
```

If you have chosen `conda` as your package manager, you can run scripts with:

```bash
cd path/to/folder
python script.py
```

Jupyter notebooks ([details](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/jupyter/#using-jupyter-within-a-project)) can be launched with:

```bash
cd path/to/folder
uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab --allow-root
```

## Development workflow

### Run tests and check test coverage

```bash
cd path/to/folder
uv run pytest
uv run pytest --cov --cov-report term-missing
```

### Pre-commit and lint code

To ensure code quality, we use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks. These hooks automatically run checks on your code before committing changes. Among the pre-commit hooks, we also use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to enforce code style and linting. All the pre-commit hooks are defined in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

To run pre-commit hooks, you can use:
```bash
uvx pre-commit
```

## Documentation

The [documentation](https://open-energy-transition.github.io/demandcast/) is currently hosted on GitHub pages connected to this repository. It is built with [mkdocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).

To run it locally:

```bash
cd webpage
uv run mkdocs serve
```
